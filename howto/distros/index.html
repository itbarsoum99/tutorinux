			<h2>Linux Distributions</h2>
      <p>There are more than 25 popular different <a href="https://linux.org/pages/download">Linux distributions</a> (and hundreds more for specific interfaces), and everyone has a favorite. This is your guide to some of the major distros.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Ubuntu</h2>
			<p>Ubuntu is one of the most-used Linux distributions, and many other distributions are based on it.</p>
			<h4>Pros:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Ubuntu has a very user-friendly desktop interface.</li> 
				<li>Ubuntu has many apps available, including most major web browsers, team communication, music, and programming applications.</li>
				<li>Ubuntu comes with <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>, a free, open-source office suite that's compatible with Microsoft Office, with none of the price.</li>
				<li>Ubuntu comes with a built in <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/">email client</a> as well as <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> as the default web browser (other browsers can be installed and made the default).</li>
				<li>Regular updates and upgrades.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Cons:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Ubuntu has begun bringing ads to the Linux desktop, a norm-defying move.</li>

			</ul>

			<h2>Linux Mint</h2>
			<p></p>
			<h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>It works out of the box, with full multimedia support and is extremely easy to use.</li>
        <li>It's both free of cost and open source.</li>
        <li>It's community-driven. Users are encouraged to send feedback to the project so that their ideas can be used to improve Linux Mint.</li>
        <li>Based on <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> and ,<a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, it provides about 30,000 packages and one of the best software managers.</li>
        <li>It's safe and reliable. Linux Mint requires very little maintenance.</li>
      </ul>
			<h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Not as much software availability.</li>
        <li><a href="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FCOEt7-q1PMc%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&f=1&nofb=1">Similar desktop interface</a> to Windows 7.</li>
        <li>Outdated software centers.</li>
        <li>Produces nothing that can't be found in other Debian-based distros (that may have a better interface).</li>
        <li>Tries to be like Windows when they could create a better, more engaging interface.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>OpenSUSE</h2>
      <p>OpenSUSE is the operating system I use on a daily basis. It has the best configuration software (YaST) and is easy to use.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Truly community driven and gives its users what they want.</li>
        <li>Extremely robust system that can withstand tinkering.</li>
        <li>Lots of <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/421/en">easy-to-install</a> software.</li>
        <li>YaST: the best configuration software of any operating system. Gives you complete control over every possible setting and configuration.</li>
        <li>Great out-of-the-box experience: while other distributions require significant customization and work to run well, OpenSUSE doesn't.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Does not come with all of the codecs for audio and video, making it difficult to play those files locally.</li>
        <li>Heavier distribution, which can make it slow on older systems.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Debian</h2>
      <p>One of the earliest operating systems, it is a community-driven OS. It is also the parent of Ubuntu, which is the parent of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/UbuntuFamilyTree1210.svg">a lot of other distros</a>.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Comes with over 59,000 packages to make your life easier.</li>
        <li>Most dependable Linux operating system available, thanks to <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/">strict package policy</a>.</li>
        <li>Makes it easy to choose the level of freedom and proprietary software, as well as how stable/cutting edge you want your operating system to be.</li>
        <li>Is a favored distribution of software developers.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Comes with only free software, so virtually no mainstream software is included.</li>
        <li>Uses Systemd, an administration tool that many Linux users see as too powerful.</li>
        <li>The software is often not up to date.</li>
        <li>It is a pain to install.</li>
