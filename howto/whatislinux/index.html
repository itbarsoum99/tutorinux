			<h2>Linux Basics</h2>
			<p>Linux is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">operating system</a> that comes in many different forms and is everywhere, even when you don't know it. Linux is very programmer-oriented and contains many aspects that cannot be accessed without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">programming knowledge.</a> Although there are some <a href="/howto/distros">distributions</a> that require less programming knowledge, to get the most out of Linux, it's best to learn programming.</p>

			<h2>Pros of Using Linux</h2>
			<p>Linux is a very versatile group of operating systems. It is also likely the most reliable and secure operating system out there. There are tons of pros to using Linux, like these:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Linux is very fast. It's also very lightweight, so there will be less strain on your computer, which results in longer battery life and better long-term functionality.</li>
				<li>Linux is completely open-sourced, meaning that there is a community of developers that works to maintain, improve, and upgrade Linux distributions.</li>
				<li>Because Linux is open-sourced, it's also transparent, meaning that privacy violations are not involved in their development.</li>
				<li>Linux is 100% free! (This was probably unexpected, because you're used to paying hundreds of dollars for software. No more! Every public-use Linux distro (meaning those that don't come with a product like an Android phone or a Roku device) is completely free to download and use, no strings attached!)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All of these positives are great reasons to get rid of Windows on your device and <a href="/howto/install">install Linux instead</a>.</p>

			<h2>Cons of Using Linux</h2>
			<p>The cons of using Linux are few and far between, but here they are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>No knowledge of programming will result in your struggling to use the operating system to its fullest (though it is certainly still possible to use more of the user-friendly distros without programming knowledge, as some of these are based on Windows desktops with many of the same features).</li>
				<li>The variety of Linux distributions can be a positive, or it can be a negative, as the choices are often overwhelming. Our <a href="/howto/distros">guide to the distros</a> should help you come to a decision. If it isn't, it's possible to <a href="/howto/try">try Linux</a> without permanently installing it on your system.</li>
				<li>Linux does not have all of the functions of Mac or Windows (no Siri/Cortana, less visually customizable options for the average user, no Safari/Edge), but it has exceptional features in its own right.</li>
			</ul>
