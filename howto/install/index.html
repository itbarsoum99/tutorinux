			<h2>Installing Linux</h2>
      <p>If you're convinced that it's time to install Linux, here's a quick tutorial. There are <a href="https://linux.org/pages/download/">many distributions</a> to choose from, but if you've made a decision, follow this tutorial!</p>

      <h2>Download the Linux File</h2>
      <p>Before we install Linux, we first have to get the file. Go to your preferred distribution's website and find the download page. Always download the largest file available (should be multiple gigabytes, not only a few hundred megabytes). This file should come in the ISO format. Once it's downloaded (usually takes 30m-1hr, depending on distribution and internet connection), move on to the next step.</p>

      <h2>Get a flashdrive or high-storage CD</h2>
      <p>Linux requires a flashdrive or other disc for installation. We recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Ultra-Flair-Flash-Drive/dp/B015CH1GTO/">this SanDisk USB 3.0</a>, which costs $6.49 on Amazon and will greatly improve installation speed. If you already have a flashdrive that you want to use, make sure that it has more storage space than the size of the Linux file, then <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Format-a-Flash-Drive">format it</a>(erase the contents and get it ready for use) using <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Format-a-Flash-Drive">this tutorial</a>.</p>

      <h2>Get Balena Etcher</h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">Balena Etcher</a> is the best program for writing the Linux ISO file to a flashdrive or other disc. The program quickly "flashes" the file to the disc, allowing you to begin the actual installation process.</p>
      <p>Note: DO NOT use Rufus, UNetBootin, or other pre-installed programs on your computer. These programs are prone to error that can screw up the "flashing" process.</p>
