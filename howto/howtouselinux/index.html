			<h2>How do we use Linux?</h2>
      <p>Linux is used in lots of places where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Windows</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS">MacOS</a> will not do the job, especially in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">Internet of Things</a> (smart refrigerators, Roku devices, Google Home, etc.). Linux is everywhere, because it is extremely versatile.</p>

      <h2>Day-to-day use</h2>
      <p>Linux is an operating system that can be used just like Windows and MacOS. It's easy to install, can run various applications like Windows and MacOS, and, best of all, is entirely free. Linux can be used for work, school, and life, giving you <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">organizational</a> <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/">advantages</a> and a <a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/12/linux-kde-plasma">customizable interface</a>.</p>

      <h2>Development</h2>
      <p>Linux, with a built-in bash terminal, is easily the best operating system for all things development. Giving you the ability to use tools like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download">Visual Studio Code</a> as well as the classic terminal allows a developer to efficiently use their skills to the fullest. It also encourages development of skills like the use of <a href="https://www.vim.org/">the Vim text editor</a> that will make you a better programmer overall.</p>

      <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
      <p>Even if you aren't running a Linux operating system on your computer, you are still using it in some capacity. Do you have an Android phone or tablet? Android is a Linux operating system designed specifically for mobile devices. If you use Facebook, Google, Pinterest, or Wikipedia, you use Linux indirectly, too: all of those popular sites run on Linux servers. The automotive industry, including companies like Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Ford, and Mazda, use Linux for all areas of IoT in the car. The Nest Thermostat also runs Linux for its artificial learning model.</p>
